      <h1>Proposal for Collaboration: Learning Utsav 2024</h1>

      <p>Dear {{name}},</p>

      <p>
        I hope this email finds you well! We are writing to you on behalf of
        Learning Utsav, and we are excited to invite
        <strong>{{name}}</strong> to join us as a Sponsor for Learning Utsav, a
        30-day skill-building challenge. Learning Utsav is a KEC Electronics
        Club initiative made possible with support from the KEC Computer Club.
        This event will take place during the Dashain-Tihar break and aims to
        help students and professionals across Nepal enhance their skills in
        fields like electronics, software/web development, AI/data science,
        cybersecurity, and cloud technologies.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Learning Utsav is a campaign aimed at motivating people to upskill
        during the festive break. We envision it as a festival of learning that
        communities can take part in every year, turning the downtime of
        Dashain-Tihar into a productive learning experience. We aim to make this
        an annual tradition where students and professionals across Nepal can
        engage, skill up, and grow during their holidays.
      </p>
